### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

---
I'm Jacob, a Computer Science grad from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and an experienced front end dev aspiring to work in the cloud.

I've always had a strong interest in technology and knowing how things work, so once I learned about coding, it's been all I can think about. Upon receiving my CS degree in 2018, I started my career as a front end dev, but quickly took an interest in full stack and began building my own apps in my spare time. 

Now my key interest is AWS. I'm fascinated by serverless technologies, and I am looking to use my current dev experience to build highly scalable cloud applications.
